# Problem 1:
"""
Print Squares of Numbers
Write a Python program that uses a for loop to print the square of each number in the list 
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The output should be [1,4,9,16,25.]"""

"""lst = [1,2,3,4,5]

"""Calculate Average of Numbers
Write a Python program that uses a for loop to calculate the average of the numbers in the list [3,5,7,9,11]."""

"""lst = [1,2,3,4,5]

# Problem 3:

"""Print Numbers in Reverse Order
Write a Python program that uses a for loop to print numbers from 20 to 1 in reverse order."""
